# 🗃️ Sales Insights: Customers & Products Analysis

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on:

1. **Data Architecture**: Building a scalable and organized data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture**.

2. **ETL Pipelines**:  Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

3. **Data Modeling**: Building fact and dimension tables structured optimized for analytical queries.

4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards to deliver actionable insights. 

## 🧱 Data Architecture
The data architecture is designed around the Medallion Architecture framework, organized into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
